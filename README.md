# Overview

NeurOS, as its name suggests, centers around
[Neuro-sama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-sama), an artificial
intelligence streamer created by [vedal987](https://twitter.com/vedal987).
The primary aim of this operating system is to provide mechanisms facilitating
system interaction by an artificial intelligence.

This project also aims to create a lightweight, modular, and extensible
operating system based on the microkernel architecture. The microkernel design
minimizes the kernel's complexity by delegating most tasks to userspace
services, resulting in improved reliability, security, and maintainability.

# Development

> [!NOTE]
> Building on Windows or macOS is currently not supported at this time.

If you're interested in developing the operating system, follow the outlined steps.
Make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed
on your Linux system.

## Prerequisites

Before developing, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* `edk2-ovmf`
* `gcc`
* `gdb`
* `git`
* `hadolint`
* `make`
* `podman`
* `qemu`
* `rustup`
* `tar`
* `vale`
* `xorriso`

## Cloning

Clone the repository to your local machine by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theomund/NeurOS.git
```

## Compiling

Run the following command to generate an ISO image:

```bash
make all
```

This command will start the build process based on the configured settings
and source code.

## Testing

To test the compiled operating system in a virtual environment, run this
command:

```bash
make run
```

This command will start QEMU and run the operating system. To switch the
firmware to UEFI, run the following command:

```bash
make run-uefi
```

To test a release build of the operating system, change the `PROFILE`
variable to the appropriate value:

```bash
make run PROFILE=release
```

## Debugging

To debug the operating system, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
make run DEBUG=true
```

This will start QEMU with the flags needed for utilizing a debugger such
as GDB. You can likewise debug UEFI setups by using this command:

```bash
make run-uefi DEBUG=true
```

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
make debug
```

This starts GDB with the correct symbol file and connection parameters.

You are now able to set breakpoints at arbitrary locations:

```bash
(gdb) break _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0xffffffff80018691: file kernel/src/main.rs, line 48.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, kernel::_start () at kernel/src/main.rs:48
48          memory::initialize();
```

## Cleaning

To clean the build artifacts and start fresh, use the following command:

```bash
make clean 
```

This command removes compiled binaries and temporary files.
