# Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight, modular, and extensible operating
system based on the microkernel architecture. The microkernel design minimizes
the kernel's complexity by delegating most tasks to userspace services,
resulting in improved reliability, security, and maintainability.

In addition, this operating system aims to allow a large language model
(LLM) to interact with the system. What this means is that an AI will have the
eventual ability to interact with the user interface.

As its name suggests, this operating system thematically revolves around
[Neuro-sama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-sama), an artificial
intelligence streamer created by [vedal987](https://twitter.com/vedal987).
References from the stream and the community will make an appearance.

Lastly, to ensure compatibility with UNIX and its derivatives, this operating
system will try to adhere to the [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
specification. This will ease the porting of software from those systems.

# Development

> [!NOTE]
> Building on Windows or macOS requires the usage of a container. See the
> [Container](#container) section for more information.

If you're interested in developing the operating system, follow the outlined
steps. Make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed on your
system.

## Prerequisites

Before developing, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* `edk2-ovmf`
* `gcc`
* `gdb`
* `git`
* `hadolint`
* `make`
* `podman`
* `qemu`
* `rustup`
* `tar`
* `vale`
* `xorriso`

## Cloning

Clone the repository to your local machine by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theomund/NeurOS.git
```

## Container

This project leverages a Containerfile to streamline the onboarding process for
development. The resulting container image encapsulates all the necessary
dependencies required to build the software. To get started, run the following
command to build the image with [Podman](https://podman.io):

```bash
make image
```

After successfully building the image, use the following command to create a
container and run a specific Makefile target:

```bash
make container TARGET="all"
```

## Compiling

Run the following command to generate an ISO image:

```bash
make all
```

This command will start the build process based on the configured settings
and source code.

## Testing

To test the compiled operating system in a virtual environment, run this
command:

```bash
make run
```

This command will start QEMU and run the operating system. To switch the
firmware to UEFI, run the following command:

```bash
make run-uefi
```

To test a release build of the operating system, change the `PROFILE`
variable to the appropriate value:

```bash
make run PROFILE=release
```

## Debugging

To debug the operating system, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
make run DEBUG=true
```

This will start QEMU with the flags needed to use a debugger such
as GDB. You can likewise debug UEFI setups by using this command:

```bash
make run-uefi DEBUG=true
```

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
make debug
```

This starts GDB with the correct symbol file and connection parameters.

You are now able to set breakpoints at arbitrary locations:

```bash
(gdb) break _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0xffffffff80018691: file kernel/src/main.rs, line 48.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, kernel::_start () at kernel/src/main.rs:48
48          memory::initialize();
```

## Cleaning

To clean the build artifacts and start fresh, use the following command:

```bash
make clean 
```

This command removes compiled binaries and temporary files.
